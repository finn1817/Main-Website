# Universal Search Implementation Guide

## 🔍 How to Add Search to Any Page

The universal search functionality has been implemented across your website! Here's how it works and how to add it to additional pages.

## ✅ Already Implemented On:
- ✅ Main Website (`index.html`) - **Built-in custom search**
- ✅ Projects Page (`projects/index.html`) - **Universal search component**
- ✅ About Page (`about/index.html`) - **Universal search component**

## 🚀 To Add Search to Additional Pages:

### Step 1: Add CSS Link
Add this line in the `<head>` section of any page:
```html
<link href="../assets/css/universal-search.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
*(Adjust path as needed: `../assets/css/universal-search.css` or `./assets/css/universal-search.css`)*

### Step 2: Add JavaScript
Add this line before the closing `</body>` tag:
```html
<script src="../assets/js/universal-search.js"></script>
```
*(Adjust path as needed: `../assets/js/universal-search.js` or `./assets/js/universal-search.js`)*

## 🎯 Search Features:

### **What Users Can Do:**
- 🔍 **Click the search button** (🔍) in the top-right corner
- ⌨️ **Press Ctrl+K** (or Cmd+K on Mac) to open search from anywhere
- 🔎 **Search across all content**: Projects, pages, tools, etc.
- 🏷️ **Filter results** by content type (All, Projects, Pages, Tools)
- ⚡ **Real-time search** as you type
- 💡 **Highlighted search terms** in results
- 🖱️ **Click results** to navigate directly to pages
- ❌ **Press Escape** to close search

### **What Gets Searched:**
- All project pages (Calculator, Text Editor, Password Manager, etc.)
- Main website sections (About, Contact, Resume, Education, Interests)
- Project descriptions and keywords
- Page content and metadata

## 🛠️ Remaining Pages to Add Search To:

You can easily add search to these pages by following the 2-step process above:

- `contact/index.html`
- `education/index.html` 
- `interests/index.html`
- `resume/index.html`
- `projects/calculator/index.html`
- `projects/text-editor/index.html`
- `projects/password-manager/index.html`
- `projects/finance-check/index.html`
- `projects/unit-converter/index.html`
- `projects/word-counter/index.html`
- `projects/resume-builder/index.html`
- `projects/File-Transfer/index.html`

## 🎨 Customization:

### **Search Button Position:**
The search button automatically positions itself next to your theme toggle button. If you need to adjust positioning, modify the CSS in `universal-search.css`:

```css
.universal-search-btn {
  right: 140px; /* Adjust this value */
}
```

### **Adding New Content to Search:**
To add new pages/projects to search results, edit `assets/js/universal-search.js` and add entries to the `siteContent` array:

```javascript
{
  title: "New Project Name",
  path: "Home › Projects › New Project",
  url: "/Main-Website/projects/new-project/",
  type: "projects", // or "pages", "tools"
  description: "Description of the new project...",
  keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "etc"]
}
```

## 📱 Mobile Support:

## 🚀 Performance:

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

**If search button doesn't appear:**

3. Check browser console for errors
