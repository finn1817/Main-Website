I’m a computer science student at SUNY Fredonia who likes building useful things and getting them working quickly the right way. My style is step by step: dive into a project, break it down, solve the next problem, and keep going until the result is clean, reliable, and easy to use. I enjoy tackling work others think isn’t possible and finding a simpler path. I’m motivated by shipping something that actually helps people—anything from a small automation to a full web or Windows app—and then improving the design without throwing away the core work that made it function.

Technically, I’m comfortable with C++, C#, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, and Bash, with some exposure to Java, Kotlin, R, Perl, and Assembly. I like web development: connecting sites to databases, building responsive UIs, and shipping live apps (18+ and counting). I work across Windows, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), macOS, and Android; I’m at home in terminal/PowerShell for automation and troubleshooting. I’ve used Git/GitHub, VS/VS Code, WinSCP, and virtualization; I know networking basics (routers/switches) and how to move fast while keeping things organized.

I’ve applied these skills in real settings. In my ITS Programming Internship (2024–2025), I built a Windows‑focused Python app that manages workers across three locations, organizes data to the cloud, automates schedule generation from availability and hours, and adds a real‑time option to find last‑minute coverage. It turned a manual, messy process into something stable and time‑saving. In my ITS Help Desk Internship (Summer 2025), I supported staff, faculty, and students in person and remotely—software installs, permission fixes, and hardware setups—learning to move tickets through a structured workflow and reduce repeat bottlenecks. I’m currently IT Staff, managing and resolving Jira tickets and providing ongoing technical support. I also work as an eSports Lounge Attendant, watching over gaming PCs and consoles, keeping systems updated, and making sure the environment stays respectful and smooth.

Outside of work, I build and refine projects. The Fredonia Workplace Dashboard is a web app I built to help ITS automate and manage three workplaces, simplifying scheduling and admin tasks for staff and students. NATracker is a group project for real‑time file system tracking that we built in Python. My main website ties my projects together into a modern, multi‑page dashboard with light/dark mode. I’ve also shipped polished tools and games: 2048, Hangman, Word Search, Square Chase, Calculator; Team Manager, Shared Calendar, Resume Builder, File Transfer; plus utilities like Git Account Info, Unit Converter, Text Editor, and Word Counter.

Overall, I like taking something from idea to working software, keeping the code straightforward, and polishing once it’s solid. I’m especially interested in web apps and Windows tools that fix real problems for real users. If you need someone who learns quickly, keeps things simple, and delivers something that actually works, that’s the kind of work I like to do.
