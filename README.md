# **Hi, I'm Dan!** 👋
## **Welcome to my Main Website!**
🛠 **The way this is set up...**
- Starts as a repository reading from a single index script. The main index points out to every other folder containing an index.html which has a page of its own for each section.

## How everything works

* Everything besides the main dashboard is now broken up into its own folder, seperating everything and making it much easier to work on if needed. This keeps all layouts consitent, allows me to move from page to page while keeping my enhanced light / dark mode feature working across all pages, and lets me keep the entire project in one place, rather than split around 20+ different repositories!

* **Over 300+ deployments** and lots of updates have been made to improve functionality, mobile responsiveness, and user experience!

# **Website Features & Background**

- I currently have every site up and running through Github, connecting to my domain through my entry point level site, **https://www.dfinn.me**

- The idea was to make a clean layout combining all my individual websites repositories into one solid big repository with LOTS of projects!

- **Upgraded Theme System**: Updated light & dark mode that works seamlessly across all pages with smooth transitions and consistent styling throughout the entire site.

- **Global Search Feature**: Universal search functionality that lets you quickly find and navigate to any page or project from anywhere on the site.

- **Mobile Design**: Fully responsive & mobile-friendly with clean layouts that work perfectly on all devices, especially iPhone on Safari.

- **Multi-Page Navigation**: Each section is a full page instead of allowing scrolling on every single one, keeping everything organized and fast.

- This does still seperate all other projects besides my main website, meaning they won't be moved into this repository.

- Almost every page has a link back to the main page on the top bar!
